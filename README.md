# Zero Waste Society using CNN(Convulational Neural Network)

##This app is used to segregate waste material, their reuse and recycle.

Problem Statement:- Segregation of waste,reuse, recycle and disposal.

## In this app when user upload waste material, CNN model classify it either recyclable or disposal.
If the waste material is recyclable then that material is provided to tired industries for recycling.

If the waste material is reusable then that material is provided by the users to NGO's and slum areas which they can search from our integrated google map.

If the waste material is disposal then user can schedule pick up for waste disposal. We are also going to tired Municipality services in our app.

## At the end of every week one user from every society would recieve vouchers of amazon or Flipkart.

In this way waste is disposed, recycle and reused.

                    transport, processing or disposal, managing and monitoring of waste materials to minimize its'
                    consequences on humans and environment.</p>

                <p style="color:black; width:80%; margin:auto;"><br><br>There are several methods of managing all the
                    various types of waste. Some of these methods cause additional harm to the environment, but not
                    doing anything is not an option.

            <div style="text-align: center;">
                <p style="color:red; width:80%; margin:auto;"><br>Recycling is processing used materials (waste)
                    into new, useful products. This is done to reduce the use of raw materials that would have been
                    used. Recycling also uses less energy and and great way of controlling air, water and land
                    pollution.</p>
                <img src="../../../assets/r1.jpg" style="width:60%">

                <p style="color:black; width:80%; margin:auto;">Effective recycling starts with household (or
                    the place where the waste was created). In many serious countries, the authorities help households
                    with bin bags with labels on them. Households then sort out the waste themselves and place them in
                    the right bags for collection. This makes the work less difficult.Waste items that are usually
                    recycled include:</p>

                <p style="color:red; width:80%; margin:auto;"><br>With the right conditions (air and moisture),
                    organic waste such as food and plant materials can be decomposed by bacteria, fungi, worms and
                    organisms. Decayed organic matter is humus. Yard waste such as grass and flower clippings can also
                    be composted.<br>Composting comes in two kinds: bin/pile composting and worm composting
                    (vermiculture).Bin/pile composting is easier for many households because one does not have to be too
                    careful with what to put into it. Here is what you need:<br></p>

                    them into pieces (about 1inch in size). Do not throw in big chunks of the waste. Make sure you
                    separate the organic waste into brown and green parts. Brown parts include waste like wood chips,
                    saw-dust, yard waste shreds, straw and hay, dry leaves and shredded paper. Green parts include grass
                    trimmings, fruit and veggie scraps, green leaves and livestock manure..<br><br></p>

                    weeks, the compost will be ready. It will look dark-brown and smell just like soil.<br><br>There are
                    other larger composting units used in schools and some restaurants. These have larger cylindrical
                    chambers of about 8-10 feet in length. Waste items are usually layered in the chamber, dry leaves on
                    food waste layers. The content of the cylinders are turned regularly for aeration to speed up the
                    composting. It takes about 2-3 weeks for the composting to complete.<br><br>
                    Commercial composting units are a lot more sophisticated, as they are tested for color, pH, odor,
                    moisture, and other related characteristic that appeal to compost buyers.<br><br></p>
